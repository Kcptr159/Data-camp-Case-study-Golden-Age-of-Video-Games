# Data-camp-Case-study-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games
Investigating the video game industry's evolution, this project analyzes the top 400 best-selling games from 1977 to 2020, questioning whether video games have improved over time amid a booming market set to exceed $300 billion by 2027

When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

Video games represent a significant industry, with the global gaming market projected to surpass $300 billion by 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence. This substantial financial incentive motivates major game publishers to strive for the next blockbuster hit. However, a critical question arises: are video games continually improving, or has the golden age of video games already come and gone?

In this project, we will delve into an analysis of the top 400 best-selling video games, spanning the years from 1977 to 2020. By comparing data on game sales with both critic and user reviews, we aim to assess whether video games have evolved positively as the gaming market has expanded.

Our database consists of two tables, each containing 400 rows, specifically curated for this project. For those interested in the complete dataset comprising over 13,000 games, it can be found on Kaggle.
